Nainos Twitter – A Full-Featured Django Social Platform

This project is a fully functional Twitter-style web application built with Django. It includes secure user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their accounts with ease. Once logged in, users can create, post, and view tweets in a smooth and responsive interface.

The backend is completely implemented using Django’s robust framework, ensuring fast performance, data integrity, and scalable architecture. An integrated Admin Panel gives full control over users, posts, and site data, making management simple and efficient.

Designed with clean structure, modern UI elements, and fully dynamic functionality, this project showcases a complete end-to-end social platform built using Django.
